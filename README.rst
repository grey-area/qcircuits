QCircuits is a Python package for the simulation and study of quantum computers based on the
`quantum circuit model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`_.
It has been designed to have a simple, lightweight interface and to be
easy to use, particularly for those new to quantum computing.

    # alice, and another by Bob, now physically separated.

    # Alice applies a CNOT gate to her two qubit, and then
    # a Hadamard gate to her private qubit.
    phi = CNOT(phi, qubit_indices=[0, 1])
    phi = H(phi, qubit_indices=[0])

    # Alice measures the first two bits, and transmits the classical
    # bits to Bob.
    # The only uncollapsed part of the state vector is Bob's.
    M1, M2 = phi.measure(qubit_indices=[0, 1], remove=True)

    # Apply X and/or Z gates to third qubit depending on measurements
    if M2:
        print('First bit 1, applying X\n')
        phi = X(phi)
    if M1:
